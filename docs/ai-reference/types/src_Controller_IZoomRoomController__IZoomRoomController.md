## What

`IZoomRoomController` is a contract that callers and implementations use to agree on behavior. This description is grounded in its source declaration and declared inheritance rather than inferred product behavior.

## Why

The type exists to provide a named boundary in the codebase. Its inheritance, implemented contracts, and public members define what surrounding code may rely on. Preserve that boundary unless a deliberate repository-wide compatibility change is intended.

## How it works

Preserve the declared inheritance/contract relationship: `IDisposable`. Use repository search to identify callers, implementers, serializers, tests, and configuration references before changing a public name or shape.

## When to modify it

Edit only when the contract itself changes. Find every implementation and consumer before changing a member.

## AI-agent change protocol

Before proposing a change, read this declaration, its full source file, all repository references to `IZoomRoomController`, and its test coverage. Do not invent configuration keys, payload fields, interface members, or lifecycle ordering. Report the affected source files, tests, and consumer boundaries with any proposed change.

## Source authority

The source file linked above is authoritative. This generated reference is an index and decision aid; update it after a declaration, inheritance list, or public member contract changes.
